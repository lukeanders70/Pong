# Pong II: Paddle of Destiny
![Pause](screenshots/pause.png?raw=true)

Pong II is a 2D platformer written in Lua and using the [Love 2D framework](https://love2d.org/). It's a short game, more of a demo really, with four levels and no music. Still, it has environmental hazards, 19 different enemy types, an overworld, and much more. All of the artwork and animations are original, as is the physics engine, collision detection, and most of the internals running the show.

Play as a stoic acolyte as she battles mysterious monolithic enemies armed only with two trusty shields. You'll need to jump and spin your way over trecherous terrain, all while deflecting enemy fire with your sheilds.
